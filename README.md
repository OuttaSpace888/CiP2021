Final project Code in Place 2021: Dialysis Nutrition App

I created a GUI interface with tkinter for my Dialysis Nutrition App. The application was made to help inform the user about dietary guidelines. Patients can easily calculate their daily nutrients intake values based on their weight as well as find crucial nutrient values for food items from the USDA db. 
The nutrients search engine can help them to better plan their meals and make wise dietary decisions based on their needs as well as track their nutrients intake to avoid over or under consuming. 
There are also some tips and tricks and other useful information listed i.e. on how to prepare foods with high phosphorous contents.

Everything is implemented into a user friendly GUI for patients to navigate through.
